# Dashboard

**What are dashboards for?**
A **dashboard** is a visual representation of the most important information needed to achieve one or more goals, consolidated and arranged on a single screen so that information can be controlled at a glance.

**Main features of a dashboard**
>> All visualizations enter a single computer screen: scrolling to see more ends with the definition of a dashboard.
>> It shows the most important performance indicators or performance measures to monitor.
>> Interactivity, such as filtering and drill-down, should be easy to employ in a dashboard. However, these types of actions should not be mandatory to see what the indicators of underperforming are.
>> It is not designed exclusively for executives, but rather should be used by the general workforce. As effective instruments they are, they should be easy to understand and use by all.
>> The data displayed should be updated automatically without any help from the user. The frequency of the update varies depending on the organization and objectives. The most effective dashboards have up-to-date data at least on a daily basis.
